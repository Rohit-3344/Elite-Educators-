                <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"> A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer
                    programs.

                    Programming languages are described in terms of their syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), usually
                    defined by a formal language. Languages usually provide features such as a type system, variables
                    and
                    mechanisms for error handling. An implementation of a programming language in the form of a compiler
                    or
                    interpreter allows programs to be executed, either directly or by producing what's known in
                    programming
                    as an executable.

                    Computer architecture has strongly influenced the design of programming languages, with the most
                    common
                    type (imperative languagesâ€”which implement operations in a specified order) developed to perform
                    well on
                    the popular von Neumann architecture.

                <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The term computer language is sometimes used interchangeably with
                    programming language. However, the usage of both terms varies among authors, including the exact
                    scope of each. One usage describes programming languages as a subset of computer languages.
                    Similarly, languages used in computing that have a different goal than expressing computer programs
                    are
                    generically designated computer languages. For instance, markup languages are sometimes referred to
                    as
                    computer languages to emphasize that they are not meant to be used for programming. One way of
                    classifying computer languages is by the computations they are capable of expressing, as described
                    by
                    the theory of computation. The majority of practical programming languages are Turing complete, and
                    all Turing complete languages can implement the same set of algorithms. ANSI/ISO SQL-92 and Charity
                    are
                    examples of languages that are not Turing complete, yet are often called programming languages.
                    However, some authors restrict the term "programming language" to Turing complete languages.</p>

                <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Machine code was the language of early programs, written in the
                    instruction set of the particular machine, often in binary notation. Assembly languages were soon
                    developed that let the programmer specify instruction in a text format (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with
                    abbreviations for each operation code and meaningful names for specifying addresses. However,
                    because an
                    assembly language is little more than a different notation for a machine language, two machines with
                    different instruction sets also have different assembly languages.</p>
